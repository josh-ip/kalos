export const replit_call = `Got you. Let's shift gears now to Ashby then. So Ashby, you use for your ATS tool, what are the features that you use for Ashby currently then?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Everything. We use their sourcing, although there's still a little green on their sourcing tools. It integrates with all of our job postings, so every time we have a new role, it will go up to Ashby, and then, it will automatically go to LinkedIn.
There are integrations with things like YC, which is Y Combinator. It's integrated with Wellfound. Those aren't the best integrations, but we do use them. And then, it manages all of the hiring workflow. So from the time that you open a role, it can do rec management. The reporting is unreal, like it's massive.
So everything, all of the interviewing, all of your interview plans, all of your job postings, all of your leveling, you have to abide by several laws now where for pay transparency that's all built-in now to Ashby. Ashby has great integrations with a ton of tools. We're integrated with Slack.
Obviously, that's an easy one. It integrates with Gmail. All of their scheduling tools we use, the offer, management tool, and the reporting. So everything from the time that you know you want to open a job all the way to the time that somebody gets an offer.
Tegus Client
Got you. And so you're using all their features, but I noticed that in terms of sourcing, you use Gem and you use LinkedIn.
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes. So Ashby's sourcing is okay, but it's not as robust yet as Gem. So when I implemented Ashby, I actually cut my contract with Gem, and then, I reimplemented Gem. So Ashby has an integration with LinkedIn, which is great. It's very similar to Gem. It's a Chrome extension, and you can work in LinkedIn, and you can import. And we do that.
But when you're doing sourcing, you want to be able to report out on things like if I have more than one link in my outreach, let's say I reach out to you on LinkedIn. And I say I'm reaching out from Replit, and I'm looking for market research, here's more about Replit, here's the link. Here's more about where we are with our market research, here's the link. And here's the blog link, with Gem, I can see which link is being clicked.
I can look at those click rates. I can also set up much more detailed and complex sequencing, which is a sourcing thing, like when you're targeting candidates, you want to send and automate a first outreach, a second outreach, a third outreach. You can do all that in Ashby called sequencing, same thing in Gem.
However, there are some limitations, and we're working with them on features for this. But one, you can't report on what's being clicked in your links. Two, you have a limited number of outreach. And three, this is a big one, you can't edit your sequencing once you started a sequence.
So if I click, start this sequence, send this to all these machine learning engineers, and then, I noticed I have a typo. I'm just using that as an example, I have to actually shut down the entire sequence that maybe I've triggered to 150 people, and I have to start it over.
So that was a pretty big one for us, and the reporting was tricky too. The reporting that you can do in Gem on the sourcing side before a candidate is actually in your pipeline is a lot more robust.
Because I'm big on reporting and so is exec, I reimplemented Gem, and I just use both of them. I have a workaround come with it. So I still pull all those candidates into Ashby, but it's not as good yet as Gem.
Tegus Client
Got you. So in your current tech stack, which you have a lot of tools doing specific niche kind of best-in-breed solutions. Speaking of Ashby specifically, how mission-critical is Ashby in your current stack? So if you couldn't use Ashby or if you had to use a different ATS, how upset would you be?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Pretty upset. It's critical. And I've used a ton of ATSs, I've consulted on them, I've implemented them, I've helped to build them. It's probably the best I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.
Tegus Client
Okay. So if you've used a lot of them and you say that Ashby is the most like kind of mission-critical, what would happen though if Rippling started releasing an ATS feature or another tool within your tech stack? So what if there was a tool that did everything that you're mentioning?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
This is great. I think it would be great. I think it would be very important. Not even Google, where I worked for so long. Not even Google had something that was that seamless, even their HRIS stuff is in Workday.
And they have something called Prosper or something, but it's very similar to these kind of total rewards that you look at, when you're looking at your comp over time. And Google does it in such a way that it's pretty seamless, like you don't know when you're actually looking at a UI that's Google or if you're looking at something else. It sometimes will do. But even Google, it doesn't have something like that, right?
If I wanted to book vacation time, I had to go into Workday to do that. If you could build something like that, I mean, I think it would be amazing. I think it would be smart. I think it would be really difficult.
But I don't think anyone has done it yet, you would have to live on your integrations. That's key. The integrations are really important in how those operate. With the text and other apps, too, like your Google Workspace, like your Docs, if that's what you do, or DocuSign, HelloSign, I forgot about that. Those are other things that we have to integrate for auto-signing and things like that. If you have got an idea to build one, I'm on board, hire me.
Tegus Client
Okay. So let me know if this is correct. Do you think that there ever could be a seamless tool that does your end-to-end?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes. You could. And honestly, like I think people have separated hiring and HR, and payroll and accounting and finance, like I think those things have always been separated. And so I think it would be very smart to streamline all of those things. That's key, critical. I think that's why nobody has done it is because it's that end-to-end solution, you would need a lot of cooks in the kitchen to get it right.
Tegus Client
So this is a hypothetical question. But basically, if Rippling were to come out with an ATS solution, would that be better for you than if Ashby were to come up with an HRIS solution?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Another reason why I would lean towards Ashby because my experience has been better with all of their supports and their implementation support, their ongoing support. Their like CSM is top-notch. I don't know what they're doing, but they're doing it right. I think Rippling is wonderful, in theory, but they've grown very rapidly.
Tegus Client
What is specifically so much better about Ashby?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
I don't know how to even say this, smoothness, because that looks like terrible language. But from the beginning, from the demo all the way to now, where I have my monthly or biweekly CSM meaning, it's the same person. They know us.
When I file a feature request or I'm having a problem or I want a report, I can get help immediately, they know me, they know us. Rippling, I don't feel that way. Rippling, they have like a very big sales-driven org that doesn't necessarily connect to all of the back end.
They do have those connections, but I do think that they're very large. And again, I'm not saying this is what they do in general. I'm just giving you my own experience. We got it from sale. And then once the sale happened, all of the handoffs have been very choppy.
Tegus Client
Got you. So your experience with the kind of the customer reps has been very drastically different. And you've worked with a lot of other ATS tools, so if you could really dive in kind of like to the feature set of Ashby and if there are any that are drastically better and for what reasons specifically, that would be great?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes. I mean, the interview plans that you can build into Ashby are extremely robust. And they're extremely customizable. The application process, let's say that I want to hire somebody or I'm targeting somebody in Mexico or I'm targeting somebody in Canada, I have to make sure you can't hire anyone through Deel.
Well, they have to be 18 years of age or older. So I can build that into my applications, in a legal way, you can customize your applications. So let's say that I'm hiring a designer, and I want a specific application question to like screen them to help me really reduce a lot of like noise in my application on incoming inbound.
Their reporting is I've never seen reporting quite like that, and it's excellent. I get that it's all if-then statements, but the UI that they have and the way that you can set it up, and play around with it, I've never seen anything like it.
Tegus Client
What do you mean by you haven't seen reporting like that?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
The UI is great. Building the reports is very easy and modifying them is very easy. The way that they connect or the way that the UI of the reporting fits all of their other features is just really easy. Rippling was very complex to set up their reporting. Even Justworks' reporting is pretty easy. Deel has a good reporting tool.
I think the UI is key when you're building those reporting tools, like you need to access information quickly and you need to be sure that it's accurate. It's very, very easy to do that in a lot of these tools. And I think Rippling you can get there, but you really need a lot of help on setting it up.
Tegus Client
So when you're kind of building out these reports, how long did it used to take you to do it with Rippling?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
A lot of it had to be in like spreadsheets, you would pull CSVs and then you would manipulate them in Google Sheets or whatever you're using. I would say it could take me hours, and some of it would have to be manual. I can do it in 20 minutes. In Ashby.
Tegus Client
And when you mean that it would be manual, that means that you're taking some of the data that these other ATS solutions are providing you and then having to manually put into Google Sheets to drive the reports?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes. I would go to CSV and then do sorting, manipulating. That's actually what I do a lot for a lot of these other tools.
Tegus Client
Okay. So in terms of their like analytics tool, you mentioned their UI is incredible, building reports is very easy. It like fits in with all of the features that they're already providing. So it provides really good information. Did it give you specific information that you didn't get before? Or did it help with your data reporting? Or were you reporting on the same metrics as previously, it's just a lot easier now to do the same.
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
No. Well, you have to take what I say here with a grain of salt because when I came in, Lever had not been set up properly. So some of it is in how you set up your ATS and how you actually run your hiring workflow.
Like every time you have a role, a job, you want one job, one person hired against it. Whether you can track things like time to fill, time to hire, time in process, interview load, all of this stuff, that's another thing that Ashby does that's amazing is all of the interview load balancing.
Tegus Client
What's interview load balancing?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
So let's say that I'm hiring a platform engineer, and a SLATE for an on-site is for people, and they all have to be skilled in, I don't know, Python, and I'm just making this up, platform edge. Well, you're connected to the scheduling tool in Ashby, which integrates with Google Calendar. And it's going to automatically pull those interviewers into a schedule for you that are available, on any given day that you want to schedule this on-site.
What it does is it makes sure that you're not using those same people over and over and over again. So that you interview, you balance the load, so you give 20 engineers all Python criteria and platform edge. You don't want to pull the same people.
You want to load balance. It also then can pull in, like you want to have people learning to interview or shadowing, you would say click a button, it says, add a shadow, where it will put somebody who's in the shadow process.
Tegus Client
Got you. So were these metrics that you were mentioning before?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
No. Not with Lever. I'd already signed a contract with Ashby, and I was moving over, Lever came out with something that they call Insights or something. That's their reporting. And so I had demoed it.
You had to pay extra for it. I have talked to other colleagues who said it's not very good, I'm not speaking firsthand. But I heard that it's not always accurate. And I honestly don't know if that's because of how they set up their hiring workflow or because it's actually a tool problem, but I will say I don't run into that with Ashby. And I don't think I would run into it with Rippling and their reporting either. We're not there yet.
Tegus Client
Okay. So in terms of implementation for Ashby, did you move from a different ATS before?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Lever to Ashby. Yes.
Tegus Client
Lever to Ashby. And how long did that implementation or the migration process take?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
I'll tell you what not nearly as long as I thought it would. End-to-end, six weeks. And you run into some glitches, but that is a thing where like you shut off lever and you turn on Ashby. And that's like everyone in your company then is like, I don't know this, what am I doing, like that's a big thing, similar to when you switch an HRIS.
Communicating to your employees what's happening and how to use these things is pretty key. But it didn't take as long as I thought. I think in June, end of June, I think we started, and I think we clicked the button in August.
And it takes time for you to get everything perfected. But I would do within three months, and this is what I told our exec team, too, give me three months to actually get some reports and then six months to a year to really see like actual, accurate, clean numbers, but I had pretty clean numbers within three to six months.
Tegus Client
Okay. And you mentioned like one of the things that you used to do manually was the reporting with your previous ATS solutions. Do you have other examples of things that you used to do manually within your ATS solutions that you now have automated with Ashby?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes. I can look at turnover, again, I still have to pull the retention numbers from my HRIS. That would be great if I didn't have to do that. I can look at, “okay, I hired this many people this quarter or this year, and they left in that same year”.
I can do that in Ashby, but I have to manually match it with my Justworks or my HRIS reporting, because their terminations are going to be in the other system. So that's something that I wish that I could do.
But manually before, like all of the shadow process with manual, which is the interview, training, and interview load, I did all of that in a spreadsheet; all of my headcount tracking, spreadsheet; time to fill, spreadsheet. None of that is manual any more.
Tegus Client
Okay. So lot around kind of like the analytics piece is now automated to some degree.
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes. And also, I would say, like getting feedback, like feedback reminders, all of the automation, all of the templating that you can do in Ashby, we just did not have that in Lever. You could do it. You could do some of it, but not all of it.
Tegus Client
What could you specifically previously?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
You did have your templates, so I want to e-mail this person that I'll be scheduling their interview, and it didn't have as many custom feel. It did have multiple application options. What did it have? It had a good workflow.
So it had your stages of the process. Again, you set that up when you're implementing. So a lot of that is how you set up your ATS. I think it had some EEOC stuff. If you are hiring or you had an applicant that was from Europe, there are certain laws and time that you have to keep their records, and it would flag those things. Lever is not bad.
Tegus Client
Okay. So why did you actually switch from Lever to Ashby then?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
It didn't have the mobile capabilities that we needed. It didn't have the reporting capabilities. It was a better price. I think for the size that we were when we implemented, it was the right time to do it.
We looked at others. We looked at Greenhouse pretty heavily, elected staying on Lever. And I've looked at all kinds of other tools for HR, too, like Bamboo and a whole host of these other tools.
But I think it was a combination of the timing, the pricing, the support. They're really start-up friendly. Lever, you can't get a person at Lever. If you need to talk to somebody, you can't do that. And so it just was the right time.
I was relatively new to the company, my lead recruiter, who's also a manager, he was new to the company, a lot of complaints around, oh, permissions, that's another huge thing. I could not live with Lever's permissions.
User permissions were a real pain. And so that was a big one. And the permissions that we have in Ashby are much, much better and much cleaner. So we had a lot of complaints from exec, a lot of complaints from users, from interviewers, engineers. They just didn't like Lever.
It was the right time, and it just all worked out.
Tegus Client
Got you. So this is a hypothetical, but I know that you mentioned, and I think you're pretty well versed on like the AI space with new like feature sets. What is currently still being done manually that you wish was more automated or even like generate?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
I got this. So we are now integrating something called Metaview, which is an AI-like screening tool. So if I'm on a call with a candidate, I can ask my questions. I've got the AI recording my call and giving me my notes.
I still go back and forth on whether or not that should be manual or AI-generated. You can do the same thing for interviews. I think it's key. I think intake meetings, when you're meeting with a hiring team and you're figuring out what it is that they need to hire, those are very manual.
I have forms that I automate, but you have a live meeting, like those being able to capture those things and then have it generated by AI, huge, like I wish that, that were a thing. And Metaview is kind of getting there.
And that's the only one that I've used. I mean, there's tons of them out there that you could use. But we're using Metaview. We're trying it. I think you could have recruiters not really doing their job or knowing what they're talking about if you lean too heavily on the AI.
So I think it's good for somebody who's already trained and knows what they're talking about. It's such a huge timesaver, because right now, you do a call, it's an hour long, and then, you go right into another one and then you have to spend 20 minutes to half an hour cleaning up all of your notes. And so the AI tools do make that a lot easier. And Metaview is really the only one that I've used, and it's now integrated with Ashby.
Tegus Client
Got you. Are there other things that actually that you currently use with an Ashby that you wish were automated or other kind of these generative AI type angles that would be really useful for you?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
I think exit interviews, you could automate and you could look for patterns in AI on the HR side. Onboarding, I think surveying, things like that. On the HR side, I don't know how much you could automate, but I'm sure there's a way you could do some AI with onboarding that would be very, very useful.
But if you could capture all of your interviews and you can probably reduce a lot of bias, if you use an AI tool for screening and for interviewing, and that's what I think these AI tools are trying to do. When you're talking in technical terms, it can be a little tricky because the AI isn't always picking them up, but they are getting better, they're getting better.
Tegus Client
Got it, especially around the technical piece, as I'm assuming you do a lot of that currently. So as company were to release features around ATS, around recruitment, would you still try to look for a best-in-breed solution? Or because it's within Ashby, you already use it, would you just stick to the thing that Ashby gives, even if it's like, let's just say, 80% better?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Well, it depends on pricing. The contracts can be tricky. So that's another angle, because you've got all these MSAs that it would be great if there were one thing, it would be awesome if there were just one end-to-end solution. So you're asking me would I move away from Ashby if there were something 80% better that had everything.
Tegus Client
So what I'm trying to say is like, let's just say Ashby released a feature, like a sourcing feature like Gem, but it was only able to do 80% of what Gem is able to do. Would you still look for a best-in-breed solution? So would you still have a Gem?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Okay. I wouldn't. If they don't want me to be using Gem, their engineering can only move so fast, and so they focused really heavily on inbound. And so they're just not there yet, but they will get there. But, I would get you to Gem. I don't want to have another Gem. I would prefer that it'd be all in one. Google is the only one that we had ever seen be able to do it, and that's their homegrown.
Tegus Client
And specifically, you mentioned that Gem is better than Ashby in sourcing because of some features, is there something specific?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes, e-mail lookup is much better in Gem.
Tegus Client
Okay. And right now, how is Ashby's sourcing tool in comparison to Gem at this moment, if you were to give like a percentage rate?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
I would say maybe 50%.
Tegus Client
And that's because like of the reporting, the sequencing, e-mail lookup?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Sequencing, sourcing outbound talent it's a whole another thing, like targeted talent is a whole another thing. And the Gem's capabilities to organize all of that is just much more built out. I mean, it is meant for outbound targeted sourcing. I need to find a needle in a haystack, and the talent mapping capabilities are just better. That's what it is. It's a sourcing tool.
Tegus Client
Okay. Not an applicant tracker. If your ATS tool eventually became an HRIS tool, would it be a harder sell to kind of the broader team if you wanted to implement that?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes. Because then you're talking about payroll, finance, billing. Again, I think traditionally, you see a separation between getting the talent in the door and then all of your employee management, there's a separation there.
That's why you have a recruiter and you have an HRBP or people manager, people ops. You've got all of your learning and development. That's all on the HR side. And I think that if it were something good, I don't think it would be a hard sell. But you do have a lot more stakeholders that you have to think about.
Tegus Client
And would it be an easier sell if you went the other way, so if you had an HRIS tool that implemented an ATS feature?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes, you could. So I think that probably would be an easier sell. I don't know that. I think Rippling has an ATS, but it's not what I would want to use for my recruiting, I think it'd be lot easier to sell, to have all of your HR processes set up, and then add an ATS to it, I think that would be the easier sell.
Tegus Client
Okay. Those are kind of all my questions for the day. But do you think I'm missing anything? Or is there anything else that you would want to like tell me about that I might have missed the question on?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
The only thing I think I missed in an ATS you have to have is some kind of like employee referral process and program in your ATS side. And then, it would be awesome if it connected to your HRIS because if you have a referral program like we do, where you give a sum of money after, let's say, Person A refers somebody to a recruiter that goes into your ATS, that goes in with a referral, and like how you know this person and why we should hire them and all of this stuff.
And then, let's say that Person A gets hired 90 days after the new person has been with the company, then gets a referral fee. That's all right now. Like we're doing that all manually tracking that. As we are going to be watching as we have employee referrals, it doesn't connect to Rippling though.
So like I manually track our finance department, when I onboard somebody, it all has to be like manual notes. This person was referred by Person A, Person A gets the referral fee after Person B has been sitting in their seat for 90 days. They get $2,000. I'm just making that up. So it would be great if that were seamless too.
Tegus Client
And are there any other features that you can think of that are missing from Ashby that you wish they would have?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
A couple of picky things, I think that they need to develop their mobile application a little bit more, and they'll get there. But being able to do everything on your mobile, maybe download your interviews, right, or onto your phone and look at a PDF of them, that kind of stuff, like that would be great if you could do that.
But they will get there. You just have to file a feature request, and then, their engineering people will implement it. But any ATS is going to have to work with their customers to see what they need to implement. They're always releasing new features. That's one thing I will say about them, and it's rapid that they are always warning and releasing new features.
Tegus Client
Got you. So any kind of international hiring?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
Yes, international hiring. If I could do like easier international hiring right now, I have to go over to Deel to do everything, I have to go into a different system.
Tegus Client
So you prefer to have your EoR within the ATS before?
Head of Talent Acquisition at Replit
If you had your EoR in the ATS or like easily integrated, which is not, yes, that would be amazing. You may be able to have like your 1099. If you want to hire a contractor, I could file more feature requests, like I have workaround for it, but being able to separate a contractor from a full-time hire would be a feature that I would want to be able to do a little bit more easily because you don't want them in your reporting sometimes.
Tegus Client
Got it. Awesome. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
